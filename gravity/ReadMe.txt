
Put the map folder (without .zip) either to documents/call of juarez/data/mapsnet or go to your CoJ folder/data/mapsnet (if you don't have mapsnet folder, create it)


The map has skirmish and deathmatch mode.

Skirmish settings: You have a second try!
After you die, you respawn again to avange your death! (you can respawn only once) - the team who killed all of the players of second team twice win the round.
If the time passes, OUTLAWS (RED) win current round.


There is a music added to this map - IT STOPS WHEN THE TIME LIMIT PASSES OUT and doesn't play any longer for the whole map - there is no option to set events for "timeout" in ChromED.
So we SECURED it manually for TIME LIMIT 3:30 (210 seconds), any round stopping while the music is playing will disable music for the whole map
There was option for "all red died" and "all blue died", so for this case the music shoud start for the next round. The only problem is when the time passes out.

To hear some other voices, go to sound settings (you can change it only in Menu, not while playing) and change your API sound from DirectX to OpenAL



YOU CAN CHANGE THE MUSIC LOUDNESS: just go to the folder data/mapsnet/gravity/music
Here, change the name of any music file "MissionFailedMy_xxx", TO THE "MissionFailedMy"
NOTE: Before doing this, change the name of the original music file you are currently using - e.g. "MissionFailedMy_Mid"!! - because this is "middle volume"    :)


Good luck and enjoy discovering all sectets this map hides
